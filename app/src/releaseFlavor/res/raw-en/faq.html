    How can I uninstall this app?

Go to Settings > Security > Device Administrators and <a href="easynotification://remove_admin_access">disable</a> Easy Notification.
You can now <a href="easynotification://uninstall">uninstall</a> Easy Notification normally.

    How can I dismiss the permanent notifications from active mode and the lockscreen?
</b><br/>
The notification is necessary to ensure Easy Notification isn't killed by the system.
However, to hide it safely (test notifications won't function anymore!) <a
        href="easynotification://launch_app_info">go to Settings > Apps > Easy Notification</a> and disable showing notifications. NOTE: Sending test notifications will not function while this is disabled.

    When will secure lockscreen (pattern/PIN) be implemented?
</b><br/>
It is not possible to create a custom, secure lockscreen for Android.
Other apps that have this feature only pretend to be secure, but in the real world there's always a way to bypass them.

    I can see a typo / mistake in the translation!

Thanks, you can easily help out with that.
