    Tôi có thể gỡ cài đặt ứng dụng này như thế nào ?
</b><br/>
Go to Settings > Security > Device Administrators and <a href="easynotification://remove_admin_access">disable</a> Easy Notification.
You can now <a href="easynotification://uninstall">uninstall</a> Easy Notification normally.
<br/><br/>

    How to dismiss the permanent notifications of active mode or the lockscreen?
</b><br/>
The notification is necessary to ensure Easy Notification isn't killed by the system.
However, to hide it safely (sending test notification won't function anymore!) <a
        href="easynotification://launch_app_info">launch app info</a> and disable showing notifications.
<br/><br/>

    When will the secure lockscreen (pattern/PIN) be implemented?
</b><br/>
It is not possible to create a custom, secure lockscreen for Android. 
Other apps that have this feature only pretend to be secure, but in the real world there's always a way to bypass them.

Thanks, you can easily help out with that.
